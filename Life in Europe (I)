For the past 5 years I've been staying in Germany to do a MSc study. Life was quite simple there, and these 5 years can be concluded within a sentence, or even less: eat, sleep and then study. The good thing about getting away from a megacity, where I'm from, is that I can settle down and consider what would be the kind of life I want. At least not a New Yorker type I think.
